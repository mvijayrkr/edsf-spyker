Cache Eviction Policy

- A cache eviction algorithm is a way of deciding which element to evict when the cache is full.

Cache Entries On Local Heap

- The maximum number of cache entries or bytes a cache can use in local heap memory, or, when set at the CacheManager level (maxBytesLocalHeap only), a local pool available to all caches under that CacheManager. This setting is required for every cache or at the CacheManager level.
